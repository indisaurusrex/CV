## India Rex

I’m a colourful, enthusiastic and pragmatic Full Stack Junior Developer. Looking for a dynamic role where I can build on my business strategy and product management exposure and further develop my skills in programming best practices. 

Deciding to change career came from wanting to work collaboratively and in teams, have an impact on the world, and learn constantly. My creative, customer facing and administrative background provides an excellent foundation of energy, enthusiasm, efficiency and empathetic problem solving.
