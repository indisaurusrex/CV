Enthusiasm and colourful positivity are things I can't contain, but I'm also about pragmatic problem solving and keeping the team moving when we hit obstacles on our path to delivery. Right now I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer looking for my first role in industry. I'm super keen to keep building on the skills I've learnt so far in business and in coding. One thing that's co-most-important to me is variety, and the other is the space to learn and progress. 

This years decision to pursue a career change into computer programming came from wanting to work collaboratively and in teams, have an impact on the world, and learn constantly. My creative, customer facing and administrative background provides an excellent foundation of energy, enthusiasm, efficiency and empathetic problem solving. 

## Skills
These skills are the basics, to be improved upon over this week. 
#### Problem solving
- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Communication

Customer services early work experience made communication skills essential in a range of situations, especially negative ones. Project work at OVO brought the need for confidence discussing news with a range of heirarchical job titled people (internal and external). Copy writing and editing for customer communications honed empathy based communication. 

Seek feedback regularly and listen well in a team situation - skills expanded upon at Makers.

#### Organised

Task oriented personality, keep things moving by staying on top of the goals and tasks we have. Start early and finish on time with extra features added. Track progress.
