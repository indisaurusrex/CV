Enthusiasm and colourful positivity are what people immediately encounter on meeting me, but I'm also about pragmatic problem solving and keeping the team moving when we hit obstacles on our path to delivery. Right now I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer looking for my first role in industry. One thing that's co-most-important to me is variety, and the other is the space to learn and progress. I'm super keen to keep building on the skills I've learnt so far in business strategy and in coding. 

This years decision to pursue a career change into computer programming came from wanting to work collaboratively and in teams, have an impact on the world, and learn constantly. My creative, customer facing and administrative background provides an excellent foundation of energy, enthusiasm, efficiency and empathetic problem solving. 

## Skills
#### Problem solving

Throughout Makers we're encouraged to learn through building and designing apps. Which means constant problem solving. From considering how to log a perfect game in the [bowling challenge](https://github.com/indisaurusrex/bowling-challenge) correctly, to working out how on earth to use Rails (the first framework we were introduced to), how to attach a database and what happens when you use the `scaffold` command in [Acebook](https://github.com/jamesAforster/acebook-JIMJI). And even how to work with a team when things aren't going to plan - which I touched upon in [my blog on what I learnt about myself at Makers](https://medium.com/swlh/the-top-3-things-i-learnt-about-myself-at-coding-bootcamp-8988a39102e0?source=friends_link&sk=142ceb1479fe54b56bd29e8a7f197aef). 

At OVO, I worked with UX designers, developers and external partners to fix our broken customer communications. I led a multi-departmental mini-project team to:
- identify and redesign problematic logic behind automated sends
- discover gaps in the customer journey messages, then fill them
- make messages comprehensible to a wider audience

The project brought a 15% reduction in comms-related complaints, and cut 1/3 off printing costs, helping with company goals and savings. 



#### Communication

At OVO I had became confident interacting with all levels of stakeholders up to the CEO. I also learnt the value of adapting your method of delivery, and tone across different audiences from busy director, to customer, to customer services team.

Throughout my career I've worked in customer facing roles. Dealing with angry customers face to face at Pearl or over the phone at Groupon, I'm now well practiced in dispute resolution and managing expectations effectively. 

During Makers, regularly giving and receiving constructive feedback has been an invaluable new communication tool. We also got to practice pair programming every afternoon for 2+ months. 

#### Organision

My task-oriented nature kept me afloat while starting a business solo in 2018. Documenting and learning was important for a scalable model, while attending self-employment classes, researching eco-friendly practices and fulfilling orders. 

Managing an ongoing workload aside part time agile project work at OVO I learnt kanban boards, the pomodoro technique and how to prioritise my workload effectively around constantly changing needs. 

I've become adept at keeping others on track as well, which was complimented by a teammate in the [Acebook](https://github.com/jamesAforster/acebook-JIMJI) project at Makers.
